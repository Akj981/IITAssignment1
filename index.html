                        <h2>About me</h2>
                        <p>My interest in IT started finished my work experience in year 10 as an IT assistant. Simples
                            stuff such as downloading drivers, disassemble and assemble desktop PC parts. My interested
                            grow even further when my friend from university introduce me to Linux as a free operating
                            system when I was a student studying engineering. But felt I was not studying the right
                            course when I started to play around with Linux on old pc. I dropped out engineering due to
                            mental health issue. </p>
                        <p>Worked 2 years before going back to studies to figure out what I wanted to do. My sister was
                            the one that mention I spend most of time with computers. So, I end up trying out a diploma
                            of IT at VU to see if I like IT. From my studies in diploma in IT, I see that I have
                            strength/likes and weakness/dislikes in IT. end up hating the theory in computer networking
                            but love the configuration of live Linux servers (AWS) </p>
                        <p>I started to 3 building gaming because I love playing games on my spare time when I do not
                            have friends to spend with. I also spend time fixing android phone and laptop. One of the
                            satisfying things when fixing computers/laptops and android phone is that they can function
                            again from a dead/nonfunction state. </p>

                            Why I choose RMIT?
                        </h3>
                        <p>I choose RMIT because I would like to find liked minded people (independent learner) and
                            different mentality of studying. Felt the other university was copy and paste but stop the
                            students from using their own brain to troubleshoot programming problems. I do not like
                            spoon
                            feed as I noticed how bad student cannot think for themselves once they quickly ask for help
                            when they didn’t try solving their own problem or look up for answer online forms. Felt that
                            bullying is common at my other university. So, I avoid it all together. <p></p>

                        Defenders tend to be sensitively perceptive individuals with an eye for details. They’re
                        likely
                        to spot when distress engulfs someone – or when something is amiss on a practical level –
                        much
                        quicker than most other personality types. Much about their caring nature emerges from this.
                        Their mind-set encourages them to help when they see a need, and to do so in a down-to-earth
                        manner.

                        However, our research suggests that this awareness is likely stronger among Turbulent
                        Defenders.
                        Both forms of Defenders have a liking for thoroughness. But because of their ever-watchful
                        and
                        often worried eyes, Turbulent Defenders typically remain the more detail-oriented of the
                        two.
                        They often spot problems long before their Assertive counterparts do.

                        This awareness can be a powerful tool that allows Turbulent Defenders to size up potential
                        problems. But it can consume them. Compared to Assertive Defenders, more of them spend time
                        worrying about things they can’t control in life, which can lead to frustration,
                        disappointment,
                        and even sadness. These personalities can take on too much responsibility for negative
                        situations they notice around them.

                        Turbulent Defenders may see all that can be fixed in their world and frequently feel like
                        they
                        haven’t done enough. They very easily find fault with themselves, even if they don’t deserve
                        it.
                        They typically don’t have enough emotional armor protecting them, and these sensitive
                        personalities end up blaming themselves too often and too quickly.
