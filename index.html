                        <h2>About me</h2>
                        <p>My interest in IT started when I took part in work experience during year 10. My interested
                            started to grow
                            when my friend from uni
                            introduce me to Linux as a free operating system when I was a student studying engineering.
                            But
                            felt I was
                            not studying the right course when I started to play around with Linux on old pc. I dropped
                            out
                            engineering
                            due to mental health issue.</p>
                        <p>Worked 2 years before going back to studies to figure out what I wanted to do. My sister was
                            the
                            one that
                            mention I spend most of time with computers. So, I end up trying out a diploma of IT at VU
                            to
                            see if I like
                            IT. From my studies in diploma in IT, I see that I have strength/likes and weakness/dislikes
                            in
                            IT.</p>
                        <p>I started to build 3 gaming PC because I love playing games on my spare time when I do not
                            have
                            friends to
                            spend with. I also spend time fixing android phone and laptop. One of the satisfying things
                            when
                            fixing
                            computers/laptops and android phone is that they can function again from a dead/nonfunction
                            state.</p>

                    Defenders tend to be sensitively perceptive individuals with an eye for details. They’re likely
                    to spot when distress engulfs someone – or when something is amiss on a practical level – much
                    quicker than most other personality types. Much about their caring nature emerges from this.
                    Their mind-set encourages them to help when they see a need, and to do so in a down-to-earth
                    manner.

                    However, our research suggests that this awareness is likely stronger among Turbulent Defenders.
                    Both forms of Defenders have a liking for thoroughness. But because of their ever-watchful and
                    often worried eyes, Turbulent Defenders typically remain the more detail-oriented of the two.
                    They often spot problems long before their Assertive counterparts do.

                    This awareness can be a powerful tool that allows Turbulent Defenders to size up potential
                    problems. But it can consume them. Compared to Assertive Defenders, more of them spend time
                    worrying about things they can’t control in life, which can lead to frustration, disappointment,
                    and even sadness. These personalities can take on too much responsibility for negative
                    situations they notice around them.

                    Turbulent Defenders may see all that can be fixed in their world and frequently feel like they
                    haven’t done enough. They very easily find fault with themselves, even if they don’t deserve it.
                    They typically don’t have enough emotional armor protecting them, and these sensitive
                    personalities end up blaming themselves too often and too quickly.
